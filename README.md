# DementAId

DementAId aims to ease the treatment of dementia patients for the patient, their caretaker, and their family.

DementAId includes three main functions: reminders, blogs, and an AI chatbot.

Each function is free to use and easily accessible to provide effective care. When a caretaker is not around, there are reminders and an AI chatbot to compensate and remind the patient of things they need to do. The patient can keep in touch with their memories through the blog function to share with their grandchildren and pass down their stories.

**Note:** The main branch uses Flask to host the application. To view the site using the main branch, go to the directory and run 'python3 app.py in your terminal.
Alternatively, you can open app.py and press the 'run' button in VS Code.
